This project was assigned for my Graduate Artificial Intelligence course. The task was to predict the closing price of Apple stock for five days. I implemented an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) which usedBack Propagation to train my network. The economic indicators I used to train my network was the opening, High, low, and closing cost of the stock for the previous 10 days. I wrote this program in Java using a matrix library I found online.
